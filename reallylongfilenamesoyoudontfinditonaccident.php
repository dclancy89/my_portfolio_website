			<h3>Why did you hide the FAQ?</h3>
			<p>I have what I consider an odd sense of humor, so I thought it would be amusing to hide a sort of easter egg in my portfolio site.</p>

			<h3>Why didn't you build your portfolio site using a CMS?</h3>
			<p>I felt like using a CMS would have been more complex than what I wanted for my portfolio site. Simple yet Stylish.</p>

			<h3>Are the examples in your porfolio the only web development work you have?</h3>
			<p>No. My portfolio website is for everything I've done freelance or on my own time. If you want a list of websites I've done for companies I've worked for, I would be happy to show you in person.</p>

			<h3>What do you like to do in your free time?</h3>
			<p>I have a wife, four kids, 3 dogs, a cat, a turtle, a lizard (beared dragon), and a rabbit at home. I don't really have free time. My not working time is spent with my family creating memories, or cleaning.</p>

			<h3>What's with the favorite flavor of icecream field in your contact?</h3>
			<p>When I designed the site I wanted to put things on it that would steal a chuckle or raise a question. I wanted you to remember my site because of the professionalism and beacuse of the quirks.</p>

			<h3>Do you really think people are going to find this?</h3>
			<p>Well, you did. And that's enough for me. I figured that anyone who was genuinely taking the time to look through my work would find the FAQ.</p>

			<h3>Did people actually ask you these questions?</h3>
			<p>Well, I asked them to myself when I built this page. Does that count? (Who's asking the questions now!)</p>
			
			<h3 class="hidden">Really? A hidden question?</h3>
			<p class="hidden">I couldn't help myself.</p>
